      <h2>What I do</h2>
      <p>
        I have 25+ years of professional experience, from leading software teams to running my own data science consultancy. 
        For more than a decade, I’ve been designing and delivering ML/AI solutions that are scientifically sound and commercially useful.
      </p>
      <h3>Typical ways I work with clients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI & ML strategy.</strong> Clarifying where AI can realistically move the needle for your business, and where it cannot.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution design & prototyping.</strong> Framing problems, designing data/ML pipelines, and building proof-of-concepts that stakeholders can actually test.</li>
        <li><strong>Production-oriented modeling.</strong> From classical ML to modern LLMs and agentic systems, with attention to reliability, data quality, and monitoring.</li>
        <li><strong>Advisory & mentoring.</strong> Helping teams think clearly about metrics, experimentation, and the trade-offs between complexity and robustness.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>How I think about ML & AI</h2>
      <p>
        My bias is simple: <strong>AI must earn its place by delivering value.</strong> 
        That means we start from the problem and constraints, not from a specific model or trend.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Science as a guide.</strong> Scientific thinking, proper baselines, and honest evaluation before ambitious claims.</li>
        <li><strong>Simplicity first.</strong> Prefer simpler models and systems when they solve the problem adequately — sophistication only when it truly buys us something.</li>
        <li><strong>End-to-end view.</strong> From data collection and labeling to deployment, observability, and iteration — not just modeling in isolation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Areas I often work in</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Forecasting & Optimization.</strong> Demand forecasting, labor planning, inventory optimization, and scenario modeling for operational decisions.</li>
    <li><strong>Pricing & Revenue Intelligence.</strong> Dynamic pricing models, elasticity estimation, and financial impact simulations.</li>
    <li><strong>Customer & Behavioral Analytics.</strong> Segmentation, churn prediction, personalization, and recommender systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Applied ML Systems.</strong> End-to-end pipelines for classification, prediction, simulation, and decision automation across retail, finance, and SaaS.</li>
    <li><strong>Decision support with LLMs.</strong> Question-answering and agentic systems on top of structured and unstructured internal data.</li>
    <li><strong>Optimization & simulation.</strong> Combining ML, optimization, and domain knowledge to support strategic planning and resource allocation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    My work spans multiple sectors, but the common thread is pragmatic, value-focused AI that improves decisions and outcomes.
